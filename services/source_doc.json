Today, we stand as a testament to the enduring spirit of construction and development. Dorra Group is a family-owned business, and its ownership and management have remained within the Dorra family since its founding. The company's leadership has been passed down through generations, with key members of the Dorra family taking on significant roles in the business. Key Members of the Dorra Family:Mohamed Hassan Dorra: The founder of Dorra Group, he established the company in 1943 and laid the foundation for its growth and diversification. Tamer Mohamed Dorra: A prominent figure in the company, he has been involved in various aspects of the business, including overseeing major projects and guiding the company’s strategic direction. Hassan Mohamed Dorra: Another key family member who has played a significant role in the company’s operations and development over the years. Hisham Mohamed Dorra: Involved in the group's activities, he has contributed to expanding and managing different business sectors within the company. The Dorra family continues to actively manage the company, ensuring that it remains one of Egypt’s leading real estate and construction firms. Their ongoing involvement reflects the company’s strong familial roots and commitment to maintaining its legacy of excellence. Founded in 1943, by the late Eng. Mohamed Dorra, a highly respected statesman, constituent leader and businessman, his passion and affection for the Egyptian people led to the establishment of what is today, one of Egypt’s foremost and respected Construction and Development companies, with strategic investments throughout the region and the influence to follow, being distinguished as one of Egypt’s eldest family run construction business. Dorra Group has welcomed Malak, his great-granddaughter, marking the beginning of the fourth generation. Since Egypt’s first democratic president, Dorra has resolutely operated, consistently supporting our country and its leaders; from President Mohamed Naguib to President Abdelfattah El Sisi. Despite being nationalized in 1961; our commitment to Arab nations eventually extended beyond borders, much to the comparable success witnessed back home in Egypt, DORRA Group proved again to be a formidable force in their middle eastern campaign. “In our pursuit to transcend national borders, the company strategically embraced a collaborative approach, forming joint ventures with renowned international construction entities such as the British firm John Laing International and Costain, American firm Harpers and Howards, Japanese firm Dia-Nippon and the Spanish firm Cimy,” Malak Dorra reveals. Dorra’s impact on operations and business activities in Egypt positively influenced a major shift in the way Egypt envisioned future cities, pioneering the concept and development of residential compounds in Sheikh Zayed City. Later this became the foundation of success for many property developers, transforming the real estate development landscape nationwide. Today, Sheikh Zayed City stands as a vibrant home to 95,854 Egyptians, boasting over 60 gated communities and hosting a diverse array of businesses, medical facilities, sporting clubs and educational institutions, embodying a remarkable journey of growth and progress. Renowned for maintaining long-lasting relationships with their clients, for instance, Dorra was contracted for one of Egypt’s top developers in 2011 and has since been a key partner in their growth and success with over 25 developments to date alongside them.",

Hassan Allam's journey embodies the true spirit of entrepreneurship, as he defied odds, persevered through challenges, and ultimately achieved remarkable success. Born in Port Said, he left school at a young age to help his father run a small store selling construction supplies. In 1923, the 19-year-old boy moved to Cairo where he started a small informal contracting company. He founded his first official firm, Hassan Mohammed Allam & Co., in 1936. A pivotal moment came in 1938 when Hassan secured his first major contract to build El Kassaseen Hospital after King Farouk's car accident nearby. More contracts followed for power plants, refineries and other infrastructure projects. Hassan's firm soon competed with Egypt's largest contractors. In the 1940s, future President Anwar El-Sadat briefly worked disguised as a truck driver at Hassan's company to avoid persecution. He later founded Hassan Allam Sons in 1975, when economic reforms enabled private business again. Today, two streets in Cairo hold his name, commemorating the journey of a humble shopkeeper who rose to build Egypt's infrastructure and earn a place in the nation's history. Our VisionWe aim to be recognized as one of the world’s leading integrated solution providers.",

Summer season: from 1st of May till 30th of September. DesignEl Gouna’s 18-hole championship Golf Course boasts year-round golfing in a setting graced with stunning panoramic views of the Red Sea mountains, turquoise waterways and sunny skies year long. Designed by Gene Bates and Fred Couples, El Gouna Golf Club Championship Course offers enjoyable golf rounds for all levels of golfers with multiple tees location on each hole. The golf course bunker features, waterways and native areas play a vital role for each individual player, a truly challenging rewarding experience. Practice FacilitiesGolfers can warm up at the town’s unique Aqua Driving Range and practice area with pitching- chipping area and 2 putting greens accommodates up to 30 players, while there are numerous high-quality hotels just a short walk along the lagoon from the resort. Playing the CourseOut on the greens and fairways, the course’s obstacles and varied wind currents will challenge the creativity and hone the ability of every golfer. The par five fourth hole heads straight into the prevailing wind and requires at least two well-placed wood strokes to close in on the green. The ninth hole plays towards the La Rotisserie Restaurant in the clubhouse tower, and while it is a relatively easy drive for beginners, it presents a serious challenge for those hitting off the championship tees. The green itself is a large target, but once there, a long putt is often required. Only a careful read of the terrain will save you from the dreaded three-putt. The back nine has its own surprises. The longest par four is the fourteenth hole, where nearly 440 meters separate the championship tee from the flag. To have a reasonable shot to the green, the golfer must be courageous enough to carry a bunker on the left side of the fairway that ends 250 meters from the tee. Another signature hole is the 17th, a long, narrow and gentle dogleg to the right running along the lagoon that separates the back nine from the Steigenberger Golf Resort. Accuracy on the drive is essential to avoid the sand and water traps to the right and the fairway bunker on the left. Golf LessonsEl Gouna Golf Club provides many golf training programs that are unique and efficient with a fun and enjoyable learning environment for golfers of all ages and levels of skill, designed by our multilingual experienced Golf Professionals who are available to assist you in elevating your game of golf and making it more enjoyable.

The course balances desert landscape with lush, green fairways and is sculpted to complement the native areas and surrounding residential buildings. Designed for players of all levels, Ancient Sands follows the site's natural topography, with the lagoons creating natural water hazards for many holes. Currently, 9 holes are already playable, further 9 holes are planned to open in a second stage. Practice FacilitiesWarm up before a round, or work out the kinks after a challenging game. Golfers can improve their swing at Ancient Sands' practice facility, which includes a full-size grass driving range, chipping green, practice bunker and putting green. Playing the CourseWith four sets of tee locations on each hole, golfers have ample opportunities to improve their game or simply abide by their actual handicap level. The multiple sets of tees impose on individual players of all skills a unique strategy at each hole. The challenging lagoons, lakes, as well as several sand bunkers and native desert areas will test players’ abilities. The course is considered more challenging when the back tees are used, and less difficult when the remaining tees are used accordingly. Golfers should expect many target fairways and approach shots over lakes or lagoons by desert green complexes. Poorly played shots can be severely penalized or nicely rewarded, making the Ancient Sands Golf course a true game of sport in an awe-inspiring setting.
